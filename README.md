Some of them have the H3 CPU, some H2+ CPU, but they all work the same.

Some have 256MB RAM, and some have 512MB... all are suitable for light server applications and python programs.

Get a microSD card of "Class 10", 16 GB or larger, to have acceptable speed and space to grow.

Wifi works slowly, so it is preferable to use an ethernet cable.

The USB charger should be 1.0 amp or greater

Select the downloaded file, select the destination disk (the microSD), and start writing the Linux filesystem in the microSD.

After verification, the microSD is ready to be inserted in the OrangePi Zero :happy:

<b>This paragraph is valid ONLY if you run Linux in your laptop</b>
By default, the system you just burned in the microSD card will connect to the wired ethernet network, and get an automatic DHCP address.<br>
If you want to configure a fixed address and wifi network, look into the microSD's  "/boot/armbian_first_run.txt.template"<br>
Duplicate it in the same folder without the ".template". Look at the instructions in that file.

Insert the microSD card in the OrangePi Zero

Connect the USB-serial adapter in the OrangePi Zero and your laptop.
